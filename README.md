Unreal Engine 4 Virtual Reality Interactions Plugin

## Reason for existing
This project is an experiment of creating natural virtual hands.

## Goals
Create hands
Interact naturally with everyday items in virtual reality

### Goals for hands
Hands should
* interact on the finger level,
* be able to hold things in hand, and
* be able to hold onto things,
* have natural interaction through collision,
* should be controller agnostic (easily support knuckles or oculus touch)

### Goal scenarios

* Push buttons using collision (i.e. naturally)
* Hold small objects "in-hand", being able to throw object naturally or pick items out of your hand with the other hand.
* Hold onto external onbject, being able to manipulate the object, but not strickly control it.
  i.e. hold onto a door handle and move the door, but not have the door "in-hand"
